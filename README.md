## Design Choices

### Fonts

In an effort to impart a sense of simplicity and a user-friendly aesthetic to the website, I have seamlessly integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Hind Guntur](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Guntur) and [Montserrat Alternate](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Montserrat+Alternates), with a sans-serif fallback. This approach is aimed at ensuring a user-friendly appearance.

### Icons

- I have opted to use open-source materials for icons, provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
- For the favicon, I used an icon from the [Canvas](https://www.canva.com/) and then converted it using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).

### Colors

As for colors I decided to match them with hero images using [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).

Use of various colors will explain below.

![Colour Scheme](docs/color_scheme.JPG)

- #fff1dc â€“ Tis color will be used for header, to harmoniously match with hero images across the website.
- #698aab - This color will be used for active navigation bar underline, to provide clear user guidance throughout the website.
- rgb(250, 250, 250, 0.6) (transparency of #fafafa) - This color will be used for hero texts background.
- #384e6a - This color will be used for borders, shadows, color for submit button and background color as hover effect and footer background.
- rgb(56, 78, 106, 0.4) (transparency of #384e6a) - This color will be used for contact form background and thank you page text background, to maintain visually appealing look.
- #dedede - This color will be used for home page button hover effect, submit button color and as hover effect buttons background. Additionally, it will be used for the icons and text in the footer, ensuring harmonious design.
- #a8e265 - This color will be used for navigation bar as background color before transition, complementing the green plants in hero images for a visually pleasing experience.
- #cd7c0c - This color will be used for navigation bar as background color after transition.
- #000000 - This color will be used for text.
- #eff3f6 - This color will be used as the theme color, contributing to a light and neutral color palette throughout the website.

### Structure

My website development will follow a mobile-first strategy, as instructed in the Love Running Project, with a focus on smaller screens initially. I will commence styling for the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which has a width of 280px. To ensure responsiveness, I will rely on common standard media query breakpoints for responsive web design.

# Wireframes

For structuring the website layout and design, I have chosen [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). My aim is to create a user-friendly website that maintains its design consistency across all pages.

## Pages and Features

### Header

I designed the header in alignment with the Love Running Project, featuring the h1 logo on the left side and the navigation bar on right side.

For each menu item, I included an active page indicator, shown as a blue underline, to give a clear visual location on the site.

For the purpose of design enhancement, visual appeal, and optimal user experience on screens over 992px, I introduced a hover transform effect with an underline background color transition from #a8e265 to #cd7c0c. This selection harmonizes with the greenery in the hero images, contributing to a cohesive and engaging overall design.

For screen sizes below 768px, I substituted the standard menu with a hamburger icon to enhance compatibility with smaller screens and elevate user interaction.

### Footer

In my design for the website's footer, I selected a blue color to complement the hero image, aiming to enhance the overall appeal of the webpages and create a harmonious visual experience for users.

In the footer section, users will discover links to social media as well as copyright text.

To align the footer with the header and provide a consistent aesthetic throughout the website, hover effects were implemented for screens over 992px.

### Home Page

The homepage is structured into three sections. The hero section initiates with the quote: "Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose." These concise introductions offer visitors a brief overview, providing a fundamental understanding of Interior Design. The message is complemented by an illustrative background image that reflects the essence of Interior Design.

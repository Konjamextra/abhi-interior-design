## Design Choices

### Fonts

In an effort to impart a sense of simplicity and a user-friendly aesthetic to the website, I have seamlessly integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Hind Guntur](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Guntur) and [Montserrat Alternate](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Montserrat+Alternates), with a sans-serif fallback. This approach is aimed at ensuring a user-friendly appearance.

### Icons
- I have opted to use open-source materials for icons, provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
- For the favicon, I used an icon from the [Canvas](https://www.canva.com/) and then converted it using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).


### Colors 
As for colors I decided to match them with hero images using [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).

Use of various colors will explain below. 

![Colour Scheme](docs/color_scheme.JPG)

- #fff1dc â€“ Tis color will be used for header, to harmoniously match with hero images across the website.
- #698aab - This color will be used for active navigation bar underline, to provide clear user guidance throughout the website.
- rgb(250, 250, 250, 0.6) (transparency of #fafafa) - This color will be used for hero texts background.
- #384e6a - This color will be used for borders, shadows, color for submit button and background color as hover effect and footer background.
- rgb(56, 78, 106, 0.4) (transparency of #384e6a) - This color will be used for contact form background and thank you page text background, to maintain visually appealing look.
- #dedede - This color will be used for home page button hover effect, submit button color and as hover effect buttons background. Additionally, it will be used for the icons and text in the footer, ensuring harmonious design.
- #a8e265 - This color will be used for navigation bar as background color before transition, complementing the green plants in hero images for a visually pleasing experience.

- #eff3f6 - This color will be used as the theme color, contributing to a light and neutral color palette throughout the website.

### Structure

My website development will follow to a mobile-first strategy, as instructed in the Love Running Project, with a focus on smaller screens initially. I will commence styling for the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which has a width of 280px. To ensure responsiveness, I will rely on common standard media query breakpoints for responsive web design.
